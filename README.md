- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Onri @OJB-Quantum. I'm a Navaho man, 100% Indigenous American, doing PhD work in quantum computing hardware.
- ðŸ‘€ My interest is in quantum hardware engineering, nanofabrication engineering, quantum computation, generative design, & data-driven 3D modeling.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently leading a team of quantum hardware engineers @UMN, working on the integration of nature-inspired designs into quantum processor chips & cryogenic memory made of beyond-CMOS technology in my nanofabrication facility (cleanroom). I spend a lot of time back and forth from my office to the cleanroom.
- I have been working as a researcher since I was 19 years old. To this day, I have trained 16 researchers in the nanofabrication engineering of quantum devices.
