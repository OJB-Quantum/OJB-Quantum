- 👋🏽 Hi, I’m Onri @OJB-Quantum. I'm a Diné (Navaho) tribesman, 100% Indigenous American, doing PhD work on quantum computing chip hardware & beyond CMOS classical memory devices based on spintronics.
- 🤠 I'm self-taught in practical electronics, mathematics, linguistics, & scientific computing.
- 🧑🏻‍🏫 My areas of expertise include: electron-beam lithography, nanopatterning, idea generation, implementation, & demonstration.
- 👀 My interest is in sustainable quantum hardware engineering, nanofabrication engineering, quantum computation, generative design, & data-driven 3D modeling.
- 🏢 I'm a former Quantum Hardware Engineer at IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, New York ([TJ Watson Research Center](https://research.ibm.com/labs/yorktown-heights)), planning to return in the future. At IBM I advanced the scaling/ accuracy of quantum-centeric supercomputing via quantum-limited parametric amplifier superconducting materials research for high bandwidth quantum processors. I also generated extensive documentation on XLDs Bluefors dilution fridges & highly experimental processes on superconducting chiplet measurement automation. (This made me the 1st Native/ Indigenous American Quantum Hardware Engineer/ Quantum Computing Engineer).
- 🌱 As an NSF Graduate Research Fellow, I’m currently leading a team of quantum hardware engineers for the duration of my PhD program @UMN. I work on the integration of nature-inspired designs into quantum processor chips & cryogenic magnetic random-access memory made of sustainable metallic spintronic materials, in my nanofabrication facility (cleanroom). I spend a lot of time back & forth between my office & the cleanroom.

- 🤳 "To sum up electrical engineering & electronics in ~6 words: information, conversion, efficiency, transmission, & design automation." - Onri Jay Benally
- 🖥️ You can ask GPT or Copilot about me & it will tell you more about my research over the past decade.
