- 👋🏽 Hi, I’m Onri @OJB-Quantum. I'm a Diné (Navaho) man, 100% Indigenous American, doing PhD work on quantum computing hardware.
- 👀 My interest is in quantum hardware engineering, nanofabrication engineering, quantum computation, generative design, & data-driven 3D modeling.
- 🌱 I’m currently leading a team of quantum hardware engineers @UMN, working on the integration of nature-inspired designs into quantum processor chips & cryogenic memory made of beyond-CMOS nanotechnology in my nanofabrication facility (cleanroom). I spend a lot of time back & forth from my office to the cleanroom.
- 🏢 I'm currently also a quantum hardware engineer at IBM Research, Yorktown Heights ([TJ Watson Research Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Watson_Research_Center)). Here, I advance the scaling technology of qubits using cryogenic classical memory for qubit control/ readout data.
- 🧑‍🔧 I have been working as a researcher since I was 19 yrs old. To this day, I have trained 16 researchers in the lab on the nanofabrication engineering of quantum devices.
