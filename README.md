- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Onri @OJB-Quantum. I'm a Navaho man, 100% Indigenous American, doing PhD work in quantum hardware.
- ðŸ‘€ My interest is in quantum hardware engineering, nanofabrication engineering, quantum computation, data-driven graphics, & generative design.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently leading a team of quantum hardware engineers at the PhD level, working on integration of nature-inspired designs into quantum processor chips in my nanofabrication facility (cleanroom). I spend a lot of time back and forth from my office to the cleanroom.
